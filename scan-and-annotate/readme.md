## Scan and Annotate

This is an integrated demo for Dynamsoft's SDKs:

* [Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/overview/). Scan documents via document scanners.
* [Dynamsoft Document Viewer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/document-viewer/docs/introduction/index.html). View scanned document images, add annotations and save them as PDF or image files.
* [Dynamsoft Document Normalizer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/document-normalizer/overview/). Detect the document boundaries.
